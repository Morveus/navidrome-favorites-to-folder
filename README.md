# navidrome-favorites-to-folder
Script making copies of your "favorites" in Navidrome to a specified folder. Useful for syncing with portable music players.

# Why
I have a Syncthing instance running on my home cluster, which syncs a music folder to my FiiO M17 portable music player. Before going offline on vacation, I simply have to star (or "like" <3) artists and albums on Navidrome to have them synced with my player.

# Setup
Create a `config.py` file and set your Navidrome username and password (see `config.py.sample`)

# Run
Run `python3 run.py`
